# Intro

Envy and Spite is an open-source project, as well as this documentation. This gives you opportunity to create your own document and contribute into this project. In this page, you will see contribution standards.

Useful Resources:
- [Docusaurus Documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/)

This documentation website uses Docusaurus. Because of that, documents are parsed using MDX and must follow JSX formatting. Here is a simple example of JSX:


```mdx
<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>

    # Welcome to the <span style={{color:"cyan"}}>Spite Level Editor Documentation</span> wiki.
	
    <img src="https://github.com/layzyidiot/e-sw/blob/main/images/new.png?raw=true" alt="Header" width="90%" height="90%"></img>

</div>
```
