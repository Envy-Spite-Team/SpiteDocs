## Extras

Enemies like Cerberus and the Mannequin have extra prefabs for the variants that are decoration and stay idle until activated. In this example, Cerberus gets up from the pedestal, and the Mannequin leave their fashion poses to sprint towards your face.

For Cerberus, their decoration variant is `CerberusStatue`. To bring it to life, activate the `StatueActivator` child inside the object. This will play the animation of the Cerberus getting up from the pedestal and spawn the enemy.

For Mannequins, their decoration variant is `MannequinPoserWithEnemy`. To bring it to life, activate the `Mannequin` child inside the object. This will spawn the enemy and automatically disable the `MannequinPoser` child, so you don't need to worry about that.
