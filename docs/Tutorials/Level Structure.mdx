# ULTRAKILL Level Structure

Levels in ULTRAKILL consist of *rooms*. Rooms contain the geometry of the level and the arena
logic itself. It is highly recommended to build levels this way for organization and ease of
making arenas. Here is the example of a such hierarchy:

## Room Hierarchy

The room has 2 child gameobjects. *Stuff* and *Non-Stuff*. Stuff is for waves and enemies, while
Non-Stuff is for geometry, lighting, etc. Everything in Non-Stuff is not required to have a
strict hierarchy, so you can put level geometry in it without a need to organize them.

On the other hand, Stuff needs to have a *strict hierarchy* for the arenas to work properly.
Inside of it, you can create *Wave* gameobjects that will contain the enemies for that wave and
*Encounters* that can contain waves inside of them. You will learn about them by proceeding
further into the wiki.

## Naming of the rooms

It is considered a good practice to number your rooms according to their order, from start room
to final room. For example: `1 - Apartments` and `2 - Streets`. This is not required, but it
helps with organizing when you are making a big level with multiple level creators involved.
