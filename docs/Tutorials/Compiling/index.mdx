# Compiling your map

You've finished making your level, how do you test it ingame?

First, open the `Rude Exporter` in `RUDE/Rude Exporter` at the topbar. In there, open settings menu(gear icon) and find the `Output path` field at the top. Open ULTRAKILL with AngryLevelLoader, go to `Options/Plugin Config/Angry Level Loader Configure/Settings/Open Levels Folder`. You will see the levels directory opened in Explorer. Copy the path and paste it in the `Output field`. You need to do this only for the first time.

After that you can go back in the bundle menu and press the export button(blue button with a box and an arrow). If you do this for the first time, it will take a while to export. After this, the process of exporting will be faster.
