# Texturing

# Intro 
ULTRAKILL use a certain UV scale level on its faces. Most of them are 0.2 but there are some exceptions for terminals, weapons, etc. In this page you will learn how to properly apply textures on your geometry.

:::note
Textures are images, while materials is what is applied onto the geometry. Remember to use materials instead of textures.

# Face Texture Manipulation

To manipulate the texture, open UV editor in the probuilder window. In there you can change the scale, rotation and face texture location. By pressing the gizmo button in the UV window, you will be able to manipulate the texture in the scene itself.
