# Limbo Walls
Limbo Walls now display a real location in the level. If you're familiar with how the 3D SkyBox works in Source games, this should be familiar to you.

# Creating a custom 3D SkyBox

Firstly, make your fake environment that will be displayed on the walls. Put it somewhere out of bounds. The scale ratio is **1:16**.

Add a Skybox Sphere around your fake environment. This is so the outside of the level itself can't be seen from the SkyBox. To make one, just make a ProBuilder sphere, invert the normals, and add a SkyBox material onto it. (Did you know you can apply SkyBox materials to normal objects? You do now!)

Now, add a Camera to your fake environment, with the following settings:
- Clear Flags: **Solid Color** (required so your SkyBox sphere renders, it won't render if the camera's already rendering a skyBox)
- Clipping Planes: **Near 0.1 Far 1000** (feel free to adjust as necessary)

Remove the `AudioListener` component from the Camera.

Add a `LimboSkybox` component to the Camera. This will handle everything to do with matching the Camera to the player view.

Create two Empties, the *Player Start* and the *Fake Cam Start*.

How the `LimboSkybox` component matches the location is simple: It takes the *distance between the player and the Player Start*, divides it by 16, then sets the camera's position to *Fake Cam Start + that distance*. The further the player moves from the *Player Start*, the further the Camera moves from the *Fake Cam Start*, at 1:16 scale.

Now, for the walls themselves: They simply have the Screen Field material from Environment/Layer 1. That's all that's needed for the rendering! For the buzz when the player touches the wall, add a `PlayerDistanceDecal` set to the `Screen Buzz` prefab. Walls have PSX texture warping applied to them at all times, so remember to add edge loops.

That's it! Have fun making smokes and mirrors for your ULTRAKILL level!
