Limbo Walls now display a real location in the level. If you're familiar with how the 3D Skybox works in Source games, this should be familiar to you.

Firstly, make your fake environment that will be displayed on the walls. Put it somewhere out of bounds. The scale ratio is **1:16**.

Add a Skybox Sphere around your fake environment. This is so the outside of the level itself can't be seen from the skybox. To make one, just make a ProBuilder sphere, invert the normals, and add a Skybox material onto it. (Did you know you can apply Skybox materials to normal objects? You do now!)

Now, add a Camera to your fake environment, with the following settings:
- Clear Flags: **Solid Color** (required so your skybox sphere renders, it won't render if the camera's already rendering a skybox)
- Clipping Planes: **Near 0.1 Far 1000** (feel free to adjust as necessary)

Remove the `AudioListener` component from the Camera.

Add a `LimboSkybox` component to the Camera. This will handle everything to do with matching the Camera to the player view.

Create two Empties, the *Player Start* and the *Fake Cam Start*.

How the `LimboSkybox` component matches the location is simple: It takes the *distance between the player and the Player Start*, divides it by 16, then sets the camera's position to *Fake Cam Start + that distance*. The further the player moves from the *Player Start*, the further the Camera moves from the *Fake Cam Start*, at 1:16 scale.

Now, for the walls themselves: They simply have the Screen Field material from Environment/Layer 1. That's all that's needed for the rendering! For the buzz when the player touches the wall, add a `PlayerDistanceDecal` set to the `Screen Buzz` prefab. Walls have PSX texture warping applied to them at all times, so remember to add edge loops.

That's it! Have fun making smokes and mirrors for your ULTRAKILL level!
